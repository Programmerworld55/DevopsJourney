# Shell Scripting Practice

Welcome to my Shell Scripting learning journey! This folder documents my daily practice and progress with Shell Scripting. It will include explanations of scripts I create, key concepts I learn, and any important challenges I encounter.

## Purpose

Shell scripting is an essential skill in DevOps, as it automates tasks, manages servers, and integrates with other tools to enhance efficiency. In this folder, I will practice and demonstrate different aspects of shell scripting including file handling, variables, conditionals, loops, and more.

## Structure

- Each day, I will create a new folder (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.) and include the scripts I worked on along with a corresponding `README.md` that summarizes the dayâ€™s learning.
- You can find the main `README.md` here, which describes the overall purpose of this folder and gives insight into my journey. Each day's folder will have a `README.md` for detailed notes on what was covered and learned that day.
