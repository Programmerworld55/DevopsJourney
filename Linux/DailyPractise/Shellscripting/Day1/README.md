# Day 1 - Shell Scripting: From Hello World to Loops

## Overview:
This folder contains the scripts and concepts covered on Day 1 of my Shell Scripting journey. The focus of Day 1 was to write a simple shell script, understand how to execute it, and explore control flow with loops.

## What I Learned:
### 1. **Hello World Script:**
   - Started with a simple script to print "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
   - Learned how to create a shell script file (`.sh` extension), make it executable, and run it.

### 2. **Variables and User Input:**
   - Created a script that stores values in variables and prints them.
   - Used the `read` command to accept user input and display it.

### 3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Developed simple scripts with `if`, `else`, and `elif` to make decisions based on user input or conditions.
   - Example: A script that checks if a file exists or not.

### 4. **Loops:**
   - Created scripts with `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions.
   - Developed a script that iterates through a list of items and prints each one.
   - Learned how to control loop flow using `break` and `continue`.

## Script Overview:
- **hello_world.sh**: The basic script that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
- **user_input.sh**: A script that asks for a name and greets the user.
- **conditional_example.sh**: A script demonstrating `if` and `else` statements for decision-making.
- **loops_example.sh**: A script demonstrating the use of `for` and `while` loops for repetition.

## How to Use This Folder:
- The scripts here represent the work done on Day 1. They are simple yet effective in building the foundation of shell scripting.
- As new scripts are added, this folder will continue to expand with more advanced content, incorporating different concepts learned.
