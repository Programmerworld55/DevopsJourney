# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey!  
I have officially started working toward becoming a DevOps Engineer by building a strong foundation in system and tool knowledge.

This repository will serve as my public roadmap, progress tracker, and resource archive.

## 📌 Roadmap

Here’s the professional learning path I am following:

1. **Linux Fundamentals**  
   - Basic to advanced command-line usage  
   - Real-world system administration tasks  
   - Daily updates and resources are stored in the `linux/` folder

2. **Git & GitHub**  
   - Version control, branching, collaboration  
   - Best practices for managing codebases

3. **Docker & Containerization**  
   - Creating, managing, and deploying containers  
   - Writing Dockerfiles and building images

4. **Kubernetes**  
   - Container orchestration  
   - Deployments, services, and scaling

5. **CI/CD Pipelines**  
   - Automation tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins  
   - Building and deploying pipelines

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
   - Tools like Terraform and Ansible  
   - Provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure

7. **Cloud Services (AWS)**  
   - Core AWS services for DevOps (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, etc.)  
   - Deployment, monitoring, and networking

## 📁 Learning Organization

I have structured this repository to reflect the real-world tools and workflows used in DevOps. Each major area like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, etc., has its own dedicated folder.

Inside each folder:
- **resources/** will contain PDFs, guides, and important reference files
- **updates/** will include my daily progress and notes
- **README.md** (optional) inside folders may give a summary of that section

## 📚 Goal

I am using this space to document my hands-on learning journey in DevOps with a goal of becoming a skilled DevOps Engineer.  
The repository will be consistently updated with new concepts, commands, examples, and tools as I progress through each topic.

Stay tuned for regular updates!
